<p>In this miniature lesson, we&#39;ll use Dropbox to host a Jekyll website. While you&#39;ll want to refrain from using this in production because of the inability to use a custom domain name, Dropbox is perfect for sharing an unfinished website with your clients. Best of all, using Dropbox in this way is free.</p>

<p>First, you&#39;ll want to register for a Dropbox account. Registration is completely free and you&#39;ll receive two gigabytes of storage space initially. There&#39;s plenty of opportunities for you to increase the storage space you have available for free-- Dropbox regularly runs promotions giving away space.</p>

<p>Once you&#39;ve registered for Dropbox and have installed the syncing application on your Mac or PC, you can create a new folder in your Dropbox called &quot;Public&quot; (with a capital &quot;P&quot; and no quotation marks). Because new accounts do not have a Public folder by default, you may have to enable it in your Dropbox account by clicking on this link.</p>

<p>Dropbox Public Folder</p>

<p>Inside of this public folder, you can place your generated Jekyll website. If you do not have a Jekyll website already built or know how to use Jekyll, you can follow the main tutorial in this course or download the completed Jekyll sample website.</p>

<p>I recommend copying the _site folder generated from running the Jekyll command into your Public folder, and then renaming it to something more descriptive. For example, you may want to rename the folder to &quot;Blog&quot; so that the finished, generated website is located in &quot;Dropbox/Public/Blog&quot;.</p>

<p>Once you&#39;ve copied the generated website into your public folder, right click the index.html file inside of your website&#39;s root folder, hover over the &quot;Dropbox&quot; menu item, and copy the public link. Try pasting it into your browser to see your website.</p>

<p>It&#39;s important to note that if your website looks like the following, you will want to ensure you have not used absolute paths in your assets.</p>

<p>Broken Paths</p>

<p>For example, images with a path of /img/background.jpg will not work due to the leading slash. You will need to correct the relative paths for each directory level as well.</p>
